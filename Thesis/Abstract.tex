\textbf{Abstract}

This master's thesis deals with the design and development of an open-source GUI application called \myProperNameImp{Bound}. This application creates glue code for connecting different programming languages like \myProperName{C++} and \myProperName{JavaScript} within in a single \linebreak program --- a process known as \textbf{language binding}.\\
It uses \textbf{static analysis} to retrieve the necessary information regarding symbols from \myProperName{C++} header files with the help of the \myProperName{Clang} \myProperName{C/C++} compiler.

The application has been developed in order to support a multitude of different \linebreak programming languages. In this thesis support will be added for binding C++ and \myProperName{Spidermonkey} (\myProperName{Mozilla}'s implementation of the \myProperName{ECMAScript} standard).

This thesis will introduce the basic concepts behind language binding and static analysis. It will further explain the process from analysing source code files to exporting language binding code.
