\textbf{Abstract}

This masters thesis deals with the design and development of an open-source GUI application called \textbf{''Bound''} that creates glue code for connecting different programming languages like C++ and JavaScript within in a single program - a process known as \textbf{language binding}.\\
The application uses \textbf{static analysis} to retrieve the necessary information about symbols from C++ header files using the Clang C/C++ compiler.

The application is developed in a way that it can support a multitude of different programming languages, starting with the support of binding C++ and Mozilla's ECMAScript implementation Spidermonkey as presented in this thesis.

The thesis will introduce the basic concepts behind language binding and static analysis, and further explain the process from analysing source code files to exporting language binding code.
